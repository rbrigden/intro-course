# Hardware & Software #

Hardware and software are two fundamentally distinct yet interdependent parts of modern technology. In short, **hardware** is the collection of *physical* elements that make up a computer system. Software is a more a abstract concept that refers to the instructions that tell a computer what operations to perform. 

Although this course has a primary focus on software development, it is important for any student of computer science to understand what is going on "under the hood." So let's take a look at what powers our computers, phones and other digital technologies we use day to day.


##CPU##

The central processing unit, or CPU, is the most important part of a typical computer. The CPU is a microprocessor made of a chip of silicon that contains tons and tons of small semiconductors called transistors. These transistors act as physical switches that allow electric signals to flow in precise patterns through the chip. Multiple transistors are combined to form what are called **logic gates**. 

These components include CPUs, RAM, storage, and peripherals. We'll get back to explaining those componenets
