# A flavour of CS in 15 hours 

This course was taught in July 2015 to middle school and early high school students at the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center (CMMC) in Chatham,
Massachusetts. The compressed course is intended to give students a simple introduction to computer science principles and serve as a
springboard for further study and enrichment. All of the learning materials are linked in the syllabus below.

## syllabus

The 15 hour crash course is separated into 5 individual 3-hour sessions. Each session includes a video lesson, powerpoint
presentation, notes and documented mini-project.

### what is a computer?

Session 1 will have students question the technology they take for 
granted every day as they are guided through a historically driven presentation about computer
hardware, binary and hexadecimal numbers, and logic gates.

#### micro lessons
  * history and applications of computing
  * computer hardware 101
  * binary and hexidecimal numbers
  * logic gates

#### mini-project

interactive logic gate game

### cookin' up code

Session 2 introduces the concept of a programming language as an intellegible way to assign a computer instructions.
Students will design 'recipes' to accomplish ordinary tasks and then apply those methods to write pseudo-code for a given algorithm. Student's write python code along the lines of their pseudo-code and complete a thorough code design process for the first time.

#### micro lessons
  * intro to algorithms
  * how to write pseudo-code
  * basic datatypes
  * arithmetic with python
  * boolean operators and ``if else``


#### mini-project
  

### loop mania

Session 3 teaches students how to think about loops and their applications. Lists and tuples are introduced as elementary datastructures and methods as executable snippets of code. Loops are then used to iterate through lists and other common data structures in order to solve otherwise-tricky problems

	* methods as instruction containers
	* applications of loops
	* lists & tuples
	* the ``while`` loop
	* the ``for`` loop
