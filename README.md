# a flavour of CS in 15 hours 

This course was taught in July 2015 to middle school and early high school students at the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center (CMMC) in Chatham, Massachusetts. The course is compressed and is intended to give students a simple introduction to computer science principles and serve as a springboard for further study and enrichment.

## syllabus

The 15 hour crash course is separated into 5 individual 3-hour sessions. Each session includes a video lesson, powerpoint
presentation, notes and documented mini-project.

### session 1: what is a computer?

This session will have students question what a computer really is as they are guided through a historically driven presentation about computer hardware, binary and hexadecimal numbers and logic gates. 


### session 2: cookin' up code

This session will introduce students to the concept of a programming language as an intellegible way to assign a computer instructions. Students will design 'recipes' to accomplish ordinary tasks and then apply those methods to write pseudo-code for a given algorithm. 

#### main points 
  * 'algorithm' to make a PBJ
  * write pseudo-code like a detailed recipe
  * intro to math and booleans with python interpreter
  *
  
  

### session 3: loop mania

### session 4: start the project

### session 5: finish the project
